Machine Learning model on Rainfall and Dam Water Discharge Prediction (ARIMA MODEL). (codes on for ML part).
The problem statement proposed by the Government of Gujarat , i.e. ROAD SUBMERGENCE during heavy rainfall and
sudden discharge of flood water from dams. 
Our aim is to forecast rainfall patterns and integrate this pattern with the water discharge data provided by 
the Irrigation Department. We will then provide our final prediction to the Road and Building Department which 
can then further the prediction to financial authorities so that proper actions could be taken.
